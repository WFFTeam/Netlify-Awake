			Tourist Association of commune of Diano Marina – Sanremo,
			together with „Liguria Travel“ – a member of the International Dance Council 
			CID, Paris - UNICEF, and College of Tourism Belgrade
			are organizing World Folklore Festival Diano Marina – Sanremo – Cannes.
			This festival is one of the best and the most massive festivals
			of it's kind held in Europe and the world. 
			It is the best precisely because of the selected top ensembles
			from the participant countries.
			Due to extremely high interest of the folklore ensembles 
			from all over the world, we are forced
			to organize the festival in both the spring and the autumn.
			This program applies to both festivals.
